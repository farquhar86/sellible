<p>Sellible, LLC. ("Sellible") offers a service (“Trade-In”) through which you can sell certain consumer electronic products (“Product”) after receiving an "offer" from Sellible. This is done by identifying your Product and its condition and completing checkout on the Sellible Website. You must agree to abide by the following terms in order to use the Sellible Services and/or the Sellible Website.</p>
<p>BY USING SELLIBLE'S WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY BE AMENDED AT ANY TIME BY POSTING THE AMENDED TERMS ON THE SELLIBLE WEBSITE. ANY AMENDED TERMS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY ARE POSTED. Sellible reserves the right to cease or place a hold on your use of the Sellible Website and/or the Sellible Service if you do not comply with this Agreement or any other Sellible rule or process, or for any other reason we decide at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>In order to complete a Trade-In you must:   (i) Provide up to date and accurate account information about yourself and any Product you submit to us;  (ii) Obey all terms and conditions of this Agreement;  (iii) Comply with all applicable laws and regulations  (iv) Transact on behalf of yourself and not on behalf of others; and  (v) Be over eighteen (18) years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into agreements and to convey title and interest in any Product that you submit to us.</p>   

<p>In order to receive payments for any Products in connection with a Trade-In, you must provide us with information including a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, and your first and last name. 														
<p>Product Eligibility. Sellible determines, in its sole discretion, which Products are eligible for purchase or sale by or through the Sellible Service and Sellible Website and for which eligible Products Sellible will provide an offer or sell. Sellible may terminate the eligibility of certain Products at any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not affect any Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days, except as set forth in Section 9 below.	</p>
							
<p>1.	Condition Defined for Trade-In and Purchase. Sellible uses three (3) basic Product conditions to grade Products for Trade-In, ranging from "Pristine" or “Fair” to "Busted” or “Functional or physical problems." Conditions can vary widely between categories and types of Products. Broadly, Sellible's Product definitions are as follows: Pristine: the item looks like it has never been used and is 100% functional. Fair: the item has visible signs of use, but is otherwise 100% functional. Busted: the item does not turn on, one or more Product functions is non-operative or the item has serious physical damage that inhibits use (e.g. broken or cracked screen or missing parts).  The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions specific to the category and/ or type of Product may be included on the Sellible Website offer screen and serve as the effective condition definition for that product. Condition definitions are subject to change at Sellible's discretion. If you are uncertain about your Product’s condition, please seek guidance by contacting Sellible support (support@sellible.com). </p>


<p>2.	Product Valuation. All offers will be based on Sellible's own determination of the Product value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. Sellible will use its discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the Product's model, functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by you. Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer. Acceptance indicates you are willing to provide your Product to Sellible at the offered price. If you do not accept Sellible’s offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the offer you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are subject to change.</p>
<p>3.	Fitness for Sale; Phone and Internet Service. You must have all right, title, and interest in any and all Products you seek to sell to Sellible and all Products must be able to be activated for new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in “Broken” condition). The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to Sellible: (a) must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, including without limitation all import and export laws, (b) may not infringe on third party intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights), and (c) shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are free of any liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due. By using the Sellible Services, you agree to indemnify Sellible from all claims or losses sustained by Sellible as a result of any breach of these representations and warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar service on your Product prior to selling it to Sellible. Sellible is not responsible for any service charges related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent use of any Product.</p>
<p>4.	Sending Sellible Your Product for Trade-In or Return. When packaging your Product, be sure to include all materials included in your description when we calculated your offer for Trade-In. Failure to include any items you told us about when the offer was calculated, or sending us a Product which does not match your original description, may impact the final value of your Product and may result in a revised offer.</p>
<p>5.	Removing Data From Your Product. For Products involving devices that store files and/or personal data on hard drives, memory chips or the like, you must back up and store any data you wish to keep from your Product and remove any personal information before you send your Product to us for Trade-In. Sellible’s standard practice is to remove all such data from the Product; however, Sellible makes no guarantee that it will do so. By sending Sellible the Product, you agree to release us from any claim as to the Product, the data stored in such Product, or any information on any media used in conjunction with the Product and which you send to Sellible (whether in connection with a Trade-In or a Purchase), or for such data's security, integrity, confidentiality, disclosure or use. Sellible is not responsible for: (a) any loss suffered by you due to any data that is not erased from the device and transferred to a third party, or (b) any loss of data after you submitted the Product to us.</p>
<p>6.	Product Inspection; Offer Recalculation. Your Trade-in Product must be received by Sellible within thirty (30) days after you accept the original offer provided by Sellible and complete the check- out process on the Sellible Website (the "Delivery Period") or the offer shall automatically expire. Packing and shipping recommendations provided to you by Sellible should be followed in order to avoid possible damage to or loss of the Product in transit. Sellible will inspect all Products that are received. Sellible has the option to accept or reject the Product, including without limitation, to reject any Product not conforming to the description you provided to us, any Product modified in such a way that it no longer conforms to the original factory specifications, any Product no longer complying with applicable laws or regulations (e.g., FCC rules, etc.) and/or any Product damaged or lost in transit. If Sellible rejects the Product for any of these reasons, the original offer automatically expires and is rescinded. Sellible reserves the right to revoke the original offer and provide a revised offer for the Product if: (a) the Product and/or materials are not as described, (b) the Product is received by Sellible after the Delivery Period, and/or (c) Sellible receives Product(s) that are different from those identified when your offer was calculated.  As described above, Sellible typically honors the offer price you receive for your Product on the Site for a period of thirty (30 days); sometimes for a longer period of time in connection with a temporary extended price-lock offer (each a “Price-Lock Offer”). Notwithstanding any Price-Lock Offer, Sellible always reserves the right to recalculate the original offer price and provide a revised offer for the Product if, during the Price-Lock Offer period, the market price for your Product has declined by more than thirty percent. Sellible shall determine the market price during such applicable period and whether there has been any such decline in its sole discretion. If you elect not to accept the recalculated offer price, your Product will be returned to you.</p>
<p>7.	Recalculated Product Offers after Inspection. In the event Sellible recalculates the offer it provided for the Product after it has been received and inspected for Trade-In, as described above, you shall have the option of accepting or rejecting the new offer. If you accept the new offer, you will be paid in normal course and in accordance with these service terms. If you reject the new offer, Sellible will return the Product to you at the address from which it was originally sent. Sellible will give you a period of five (5) days after Sellible presents you with a recalculated offer via email at the address you provided to accept or reject the new offer (the "New Offer Period"). Sellible will also remind you of the outstanding new offer one or more times during the New Offer Period. However, if the new offer is neither affirmatively accepted nor rejected by you during the New Offer Period, the new offer will be deemed to have been accepted by you and you will be paid the new offer price in the normal course and in accordance with these service terms. For the avoidance of doubt, your acceptance of the original offer and/or any new offer is final and you may not change your mind later about accepting such offer.</p>
<p>8.	Releasing Rights to Product. Once you send Sellible your Product for Trade-In, Sellible cannot and does not guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of the Product and/or any data or information contained in such Product. Of course, if Sellible rejects the Product or you do not accept any new offer for the Product pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 ("Return Circumstances"), your Product will be returned to you as set forth in Sections 9 and 10.</p>
<p>9.	Risk-Of-Loss. You remain responsible for the risk-of-loss for the Products sent to Sellible for Trade-In until delivery of the same to Sellible. You are responsible for any damages that may occur to your Product while in transit. Sellible is responsible for risk-of-loss when it opens the packaging containing your Product and ceases in the event Sellible returns your product to you for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, risk of loss will be transferred to you once Sellible delivers the package to the carrier for return to you and you will bear the risk-of-loss while the Product is in transit. </p>

<p>10.	Passing of Title. Title to the applicable Product sent to Sellible for Trade-In passes to Sellible upon Sellible’s acceptance of the Product for the original offer or the new offer, as applicable. If there is a Return Circumstance, title shall not pass and shall remain with you.</p>
<p>11.	Non-Transferable. Any offer by Sellible for your Product for Trade-In is non- transferable and not redeemable for any other consideration other than what is offered by Sellible.</p>
<p>12.	Accuracy of all Information. Sellible makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all information you receive in relation to your Product. From time to time, however, there may be typographical errors, technical inaccuracies, pricing or other errors or omissions. As such, Sellible reserves the right, at any time prior to payment, to:(a) Correct an error. (b) In the event the Product has already been sent to Sellible for Trade-In, the changed offer will become a New Offer. The changed offer will be a re-issued original offer, which you may accept or reject. (c) Void a transaction. If the Product was already sent to Sellible, Sellible will be deemed to have rejected the Product resulting in a Return. </p>
<p>13.	Electronic Notices and Transactions.You agree to transact with us electronically, including without limitation, agreeing to terms and conditions or offering to sell your Product by electronic means. You authorize Sellible to provide you with terms and important notices about Sellible and your transactions to an email address you provide to us or by posting notices on an applicable page (or my account area) on www.Sellible.com. It is your duty to keep your email address accurate and up to date and to maintain a valid email address and to ensure that emails we send you are not filtered or stopped by spam filters or other types of email blocking functionalities. If you no longer desire to transact electronically with us, you may no longer use the Sellible Website. You can retrieve and review this Agreement by clicking on the "Legal" link at www.Sellible.com.</p>
<p>14.	Limited Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLIBLE, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY COMPENSATORY, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, LOSS OF DATA, INCOME OR PROFIT, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, OR ANY CLAIMS OF YOU OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO YOUR TRANSACTIONS WITH SELLIBLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability of consequential or incidental damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to all users; in such states liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>15.	Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellible, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, vendors and distributors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account’s) violation or breach of any terms under this Agreement. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>
<p>16.	Entire Agreement/No Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The captions are used only as a matter of convenience and are not to be considered a part of this agreement or be used in determining the intent of the parties to it. No waiver by Sellible of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Sections 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19 and 22 through 28 shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>17.	Correction of Errors and Inaccuracies. The Sellible Website and any correspondence related to a transaction may contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Sellible therefore reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update the Content at any time without prior notice. Sellible does not, however, guarantee that any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions will be corrected.</p>
<p>18.	Modification. Sellible reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. If you do not agree to the changes, you may discontinue using the Sellible Websites and/or the Sellible Services. Your continued use of any Sellible Website and/or Sellible Services after any such changes take effect constitutes your acceptance to such changes. Each time you submit a Product for sale to Sellible, you reaffirm your acceptance of this Agreement as in effect at the time of such use. You are responsible for reviewing this Agreement each time you use the Sellible Websites and/or the Sellible Websites. The Agreement is and will be located at www.Sellible.com/ main/service_terms. The last date this Agreement was revised is set forth below. Terms and conditions modifying the Agreement are effective immediately upon posting.</p>
